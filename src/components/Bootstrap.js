        <p>Bootstrap is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. <br/>It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA) meaning that compiled Bootstrap code can run on all platforms.</p>
